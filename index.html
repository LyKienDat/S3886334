    <h2>
        1.	Personal Information 
    </h2>
    <div>
        My name is Ly Kien Dat. Ho Chi Minh City is where I was born and raised. I am a first-year Information Technology student at RMIT University. During that period, I’ve been coding as a hobby so many coding programs such as Visual studio code, Python, Sublime, Atom, Notepad++and others are acquainted with me. As a great fan of sport and I always spend my time playing basketball with my friends, at least once a week. Furthermore, I have spent most of my time supporting my family business. To describe myself, I would say I am a generous and easy-going person, but when it comes to work I’m a competitive perfectionist. In my first semester at RMIT University and it takes a long time to keep up with my friends because IT is not easy as I thought. It requires a tremendous amount of patience and hard work. In this second semester, I will try to get more experience to overcomes every obstacle that I have met.

        2.	Interest in IT
    </h2>
    <h3>
        a.	 What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?
    </h3>
    <div>
        As a Generation Z, I was grown up with Internet and lots of modern technologies .At that time tons of question began to appear in my mind and I have a weird feeling about this. To be specifically, the electronic devices were surprised me when I used the it at the age of 12. Tons of questions come to my head like “ Wow ,are there games on computer?” , 
“Wow, How can people call or text or even play games on such a tiny phone ?  How did they do that ?” 
Maybe the majority who younger than me think that is just a normal, simple question but these questions have changed my entire life which drew me into the technology industry. Until now, I still want to know how these machines work and how they function.

    </div>
    <h3>
        b.	Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?
    </h3>
    <div>
        I have to say that Steve Jobs is my greatest role model who is the co-founder of Apple company and one of the biggest influencers in the computer industry. He gives me motivation to follow my passion because the first time that I has a opportunity to access the modern technology is my birthday which is the day I have my own I Phone .Before  I show my admiration to Steve Jobs. He has shown the world that nothing is impossible as long as you have a dream and a good will.
    </div>
    <h3>
        c.	Why did you choose to come to RMIT?
    </h3>
    <div>
        As everyone have known  RMIT full name is The Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology so somehow it related to technology. Also ,RMIT is a high-reputation school which is ranked at 122 all over the world. Especially in Viet Nam, I would admit that RMIT is one of the best IT university.

    I am expecting to the key business key needed for organizational planning and IT project management. Also, develop critical thinking and logical skills 
</div>
<h2>
    3.	Ideal Job
</h2>
<div>
    I'm extremely interested in this job as a developer and have a great passion for being a developer. The only thing that this job appeal to me is a flexible annual leave schedule. To do this job I should have designing, developing, testing , deploying applications skills, fully understand the requirements of the customer or business and utilize this knowledge to develop applications. To describe myself, I have a keen interest in technology and demonstrated my skills in this area throughout my career. I have strong experience in Java, Python, MySQL and proficiency in HTML.

<h2>
    4.	Personal Profile
</h2>
<div>
    The results of an online Myers-Briggs test: Entrepreneur
</div>
<div>
    The results of an online learning style test. : A Visual learner
</div>
<div>
    The results of a Big Five Personality test: Neuroticism
</div>
<h3>
    What do the results of these tests mean for you?
</h3>
<div>
    After taking these tests I have a better understanding of myself. It turned out that I was more suited to being an entrepreneur than a programmer or developer. Although I am interested in technology, I think entrepreneurial blood is still flowing in me because my parents are entrepreneurs. Moreover, I have supported my family since I was young.
</div>
<h3>
    How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?
</h3>
<div>
    Compared to the results that I get, there would be no big deal at all when they work with me because I am a friendly person. The only downside is that I often think too carefully each time when I make a decision.  I am always afraid to fail and this matter obsess me every time. That may cause a bit of trouble for our group.
</div>
<h3>
    How should you take this into account when forming a team?
</h3>
<div>
    When becoming a team, every member's suggestions will be very helpful to me. If they are not satisfied with anything in me, they can comment. I will do my best to listen to those suggestions and improve myself because this is a team project, not my own.
